# Maximal-Independent-Sets
Maximal Independent sets in graph theory

In graph theory, an independent set is a set of nodes such that no pair of nodes belonging to it are connected. A maximal independent set (MIS) is an independent set that is not a subset of any other possible independent set. In other words, an MIS is a separate set that no other node can be added to while satisfying the independent set definition.

A graph can have multiple maximal independent sets of varying sizes. Two algorithmic problems are associated with MIS, (a) finding a single MIS and (b) finding all MIS. Naturally (b) involves (a). In this exercise, we are trying to solve (b) for any given graph.
